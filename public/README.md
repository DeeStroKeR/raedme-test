# Foundation for Sites Template

**Please open all issues with this template on the main [Foundation for Sites](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/issues) repo.**

This is the basic starter project for [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites). It includes a Sass compiler and a starter HTML file for you.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

This template can be installed with the Foundation CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Using the CLI

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install foundation-cli --global
```

Use this command to set up a blank Foundation for Sites project with this template:

```bash
foundation new --framework sites --template basic
```

The CLI will prompt you to give your project a name. The template will be downloaded into a folder with this name.

### Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.

# A demo of `react-markdown`

`react-markdown` is a markdown component for React.

üëâ Changes are re-rendered as you type.

üëà Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

* Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
* Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
* Renders actual React elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
* Lets you define your own components (to render `MyHeading` instead of `h1`)
* Has a lot of plugins

## Table of contents

Here is an example of a plugin in action
([`remark-toc`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc)).
This section is replaced by an actual table of contents.

## Syntax highlighting

Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactMarkdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>{'# Your markdown here'}</ReactMarkdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
```

Pretty neat, eh?

## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can *also* use a plugin:
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
üëÜ Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

| Feature    | Support              |
| ---------: | :------------------- |
| CommonMark | 100%                 |
| GFM        | 100% w/ `remark-gfm` |

~~strikethrough~~

* [ ] task list
* [x] checked item

## HTML in markdown

‚ö†Ô∏è HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
[`rehype-sanitize`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).

## Components

You can pass components to change things:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import MyFancyRule from './components/my-fancy-rule.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactMarkdown
    components={{
      // Use h2s instead of h1s
      h1: 'h2',
      // Use a component instead of hrs
      hr: ({node, ...props}) => <MyFancyRule {...props} />
    }}
  >
    # Your markdown here
  </ReactMarkdown>,
  document.querySelector('#content')
)
```
